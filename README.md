## About the Project

This is a JavaScript implementation of the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors, played entirely from the console. The computer chooses a random move, and the player chooses their move by typing it into the console. The game then determines the winner of each round based on the traditional rules of Rock Paper Scissors, and keeps track of the score. The game ends after 5 rounds, and the final score is displayed along with the winner.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser. Alternatively, you can simply open the developer console in your browser and copy-paste the JavaScript code into the console.

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rock-paper-scissors.git

r
Copy code

## Usage

To play the game, simply call the `game()` function in your console:

```javascript
game();
This will play a full game of Rock Paper Scissors against the computer. You will be prompted to enter your move (rock, paper, or scissors) for each round.
